            These values aren't just words on a page - they're principles I try
            to live by in my code, my interactions, and my decisions. They've
            evolved over time and will probably continue to change as I grow and
            learn more about myself and the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm putting this here partly for you to understand who I am, but
            mostly for future me to remember what I stood for at this point in
            my life. If you're reading this years from now and cringing... well,
            that probably means you've grown! üå±
