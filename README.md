# uh hi

Ive never really been known for making astonishing README's. Noone usually reads them anyways. But if you're hear that must mean something.

This is my substitute for portfolio, page of my progress and passions, stuggle and sanity, and things I didn't know where to throw. A small shrine I'm planing to overkill with easter eggs and references, so for once in my life, i can be interesting and original, even if only to myself.

Usually I do software so **you** could reuse it easly and be happy, but I wouldn't recommend it with this repo. Afterall, one of it's main purposes is originallity.

So yeah that's abt it, idk why would you even look at the README, cuz while it yearns for aknowlegment, it doesn't really want to be read either. Fear's a bitch yk.
